  # M21-Book-Search-Engine

  ## Description
  This project is a refactor of a Google Books API project from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API. A user can search for books and can save books to their profile for later. During this project I learned to:
  
  - Create routes to a database using GraphQL instead of RESTful API
  - Use client side queries to request from the database using GraphQL
  - Deploy an MongoDB database to heroku with MongoDB Atlas
